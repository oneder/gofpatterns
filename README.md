<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<p>Java implementations of the <em>Gang of Four</em> design patterns</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Adapter Pattern</h3>
    <p>Allows for two incompatible interfaces to work together.<br>
    It can be used when a client expects a target interface.<br>
    In using this pattern, both parties can work together through an adapter class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Facade Pattern</h3>
    <p>Use a simplified interface that performs many other actions behind the scenes.<br>
    Allows for validation and easy call conventions through a facade class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Strategy Pattern</h3>
    <p>Allows for interchangeable algorithm usage by encapsulating various algorithms in an interface and implementing it in a parent class<br>
    This allows subclasses to dynamically access them</p>
  </li>
</ul>
